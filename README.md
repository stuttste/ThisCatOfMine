#This Cat of Mine

This game was created for Godot Game Jam #63 for the them Cats! It's a simple resource management game inspired by "This War of Mine."

This is a purely mechanical version of the game with almost no art assets and no sound effects.

This was my first completed game and was made with only a few weeks' worth of experience in Godot itself. The 'mechanically complete' version was made in a span of 4 days.

I'll likely not be updating it further as I don't really have a good vision of the final product or what I may want the game to be.
